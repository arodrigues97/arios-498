# The Arios RuneScape Private Server 498 revision.

This is the Arios 498 revision. Started back in 2012 by me and Emperor (https://forum.runelocus.com/topic/79505-arios-498-reliving-the-good-times/).

My alias was "Vexia".

This project is a complete remake of RuneScape capturing every piece of content in the free-to-play version of RuneScape back in 2008. Includes a plethora of member content.
